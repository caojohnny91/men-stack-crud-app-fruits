    The show route is designed to display detailed information about a specific item, such as a specific fruit in our application. In keeping with RESTful routing conventions, the url for this route will be: /fruits/:id
    
    Because :id is just a placeholder, we can be more specific in the case of this app and go with /fruits/:fruitId.
    
    he :fruitId in the URL is a variable segment, known as a URL parameter. It allows our route to dynamically handle requests for different fruits by their unique IDs. So, whenever a user wants to view details about a particular fruit, they will navigate to a URL like /fruits/12345, where 12345 is the fruit’s ID.

    
Let’s enhance our application to show detailed information about each fruit. We’ll achieve this by dynamically updating our HTML template using the fruit data we’ve passed. 

To enhance our fruit details page, we’ll incorporate conditional rendering based on the fruit’s isReadyToEat property. This will display different messages depending on whether the fruit is ready to eat or not.

We’ll use EJS control flow to dynamically display a message about the fruit’s readiness. Insert an if/else statement in the HTML body, right after the <h1> tag:
